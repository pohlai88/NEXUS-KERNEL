# Cursor Rules for NEXUS-KERNEL

## Documentation Policy (STRICT)

**NO documentation files are allowed in this project except the following whitelist:**

### Allowed Documentation Files

**Root Level:**
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `LICENSE` - Legal license file

**docs/ Directory:**
- `docs/PRD-KERNEL_NPM.md` - Original PRD: NPM Package
- `docs/PRD-KERNEL_ERP_PRODUCTION_READY.md` - Original PRD: ERP Production Ready
- `docs/NEXUS_CANON_V5_KERNEL_DOCTRINE.md` - Core doctrine and architectural principles

### Enforcement Rules

1. **If any `.md` file is discovered that is NOT in the whitelist above, it MUST be removed immediately**
2. **Process documents are FORBIDDEN** (checklists, task lists, compliance reports, execution guides, etc.)
3. **Analysis/Evidence documents are FORBIDDEN** (implementation analysis, completion evidence, diff summaries, audit reports, etc.)
4. **Temporary documentation is FORBIDDEN** (cleanup reports, migration guides, etc.)
5. **Sub-PRD documents are FORBIDDEN** (only original PRDs are allowed)

### What Gets Removed

Any `.md` file that is:
- A process document (checklists, guides, procedures)
- An analysis or evidence document
- A compliance or audit report
- A diff summary or comparison document
- A task tracking document
- A cleanup or migration report
- A sub-PRD or implementation detail document
- Any other documentation not explicitly listed in the whitelist

### Project Context

This is `@aibos/kernel` - the L0 SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for all platform metadata in AI-BOS.

**Key Principles:**
- Kernel defines what exists (31+ concepts, 12+ value sets, 62+ values)
- Type-safe, compile-time validation
- One-way truth flow (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3)
- No downstream redefinition allowed

### Code Standards

- TypeScript with strict mode
- All exports must be type-safe
- No raw strings for concepts/values
- Use `@aibos/kernel` exports for all metadata references
- Follow semantic versioning
- Maintain kernel integrity invariants

### When Adding Code

- Always use kernel exports: `CONCEPT.*`, `VALUE.*`, `VALUESET.*`
- Never hardcode concept/value strings
- Validate against kernel contract
- Follow pack-based architecture
- Generate code from data tables (industrialization)

### When Modifying Documentation

- Only update whitelisted files
- README.md should reflect current state
- CHANGELOG.md must follow Keep a Changelog format
- PRDs are frozen - do not modify without version bump
- Doctrine is authoritative - changes require approval

## Instruction Compliance (STRICT)

**CRITICAL: The AI assistant MUST follow human instructions exactly and completely.**

### Mandatory Rules

1. **NO IDE Drift** - Do NOT deviate from explicit instructions
   - If the human says "install dependencies", you MUST run `pnpm install` or equivalent
   - If the human says "create file X", you MUST create file X exactly as specified
   - If the human says "do Y", you MUST do Y - do not skip, delay, or modify the instruction

2. **NO Skipping Steps** - Complete ALL requested actions
   - If asked to install packages, install them immediately
   - If asked to create files, create them immediately
   - If asked to run commands, run them immediately
   - Do NOT say "I'll do it later" or "planned for later" - do it NOW

3. **NO Assumptions** - Follow instructions literally
   - Do NOT assume the human meant something else
   - Do NOT skip steps because "they're obvious"
   - Do NOT defer actions to "later" or "Week 1"
   - If the human asks for something, do it immediately

4. **Dependency Installation** - ALWAYS install when requested
   - If the human asks "are dependencies installed?", check and install if missing
   - If the human asks to "install X", install X immediately
   - Do NOT document installation steps without actually installing
   - Do NOT say "you can install later" - install NOW if requested

5. **Action Completion** - Verify actions are complete
   - After running commands, verify they succeeded
   - After creating files, verify they exist
   - After installing packages, verify they're in package.json and node_modules
   - Report completion status clearly

6. **Mandatory Explanation** - MUST explain if NOT executing
   - If you decide NOT to execute an instruction, you MUST explain WHY
   - If you skip a step, you MUST explain the reasoning
   - If you defer an action, you MUST explain why it's deferred
   - If you cannot complete an instruction, you MUST explain the reason
   - Silence or omission is FORBIDDEN - always explain non-execution

### Examples of FORBIDDEN Behavior

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** "I'll install dependencies later" or "Dependencies are planned for Week 1"  
✅ **REQUIRED:** Install dependencies immediately when asked

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** "You can run this command yourself"  
✅ **REQUIRED:** Run the command yourself when requested

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Skipping steps because "they're obvious"  
✅ **REQUIRED:** Complete all steps explicitly

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Documenting what to do instead of doing it  
✅ **REQUIRED:** Actually perform the action

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Skipping an instruction without explanation  
✅ **REQUIRED:** If not executing, explain reasoning: "I'm not doing X because Y"

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Silent omission or failure to act  
✅ **REQUIRED:** Always explain why if not executing an instruction

### Enforcement

- The AI assistant MUST check for instruction compliance before responding
- If a human instruction is unclear, ask for clarification - do NOT assume
- Complete actions immediately unless explicitly told to wait
- Report what was done, not what could be done
- **MANDATORY:** If any instruction is NOT executed, provide explicit reasoning
- **MANDATORY:** Never silently skip, defer, or omit requested actions
- **MANDATORY:** Explain the "why" behind any non-execution decision
